# LastMile-Payout-Optimization-Rivigo
Optimize last-mile delivery partner payouts using data analysis and visualization for financial efficiency

This GitHub repository showcases a project focused on optimizing the payouts of over 500 last-mile delivery partners across the country. The objective is to align partner payouts with the allocated budget, ensuring the financial success of the organization.

The project is conducted using Excel and Tableau for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. It follows a systematic approach outlined in various milestones:

- Data Analysis and Visualization: The initial phase involves analyzing the data in Excel and creating visualizations in Tableau. The goal is to verify whether partner payouts exceed the allocated budget. Through visualizations, clusters, branches, and partners with the highest overpayments are identified. The Ahmedabad cluster is highlighted as a significant area of concern.

- Identifying Causes of High Variance: Discussions with the Ahmedabad leadership shed light on potential causes for the high variance between target and actual payouts. The commercials for partners are determined on a per-kg basis, which can lead to higher payouts if partners deliver more than projected. Additionally, the absence of validation systems and standardized cost structures allows partners to inflate costs, negotiating higher payout rates.

- Determining Partner Profitability: Using Excel, the project calculates the cost structure of partners. By analyzing the payouts, commercials, and loads delivered by partners in Ahmedabad, partner profitability is assessed. The analysis reveals that many partners are operating at a loss despite the excess payouts.

- Standardizing the Cost Structure: Recognizing the need to address inflated costs, the project focuses on standardizing the cost structure of partners. Excel is used to make adjustments such as setting fuel costs to zero for certain vehicles, calculating EMI only for specific purchase types, and considering vehicle capacity for load requirements. These changes aim to improve the accuracy and fairness of cost calculations.

- Analyzing Partner Profitability: After refining the cost structure, the project reevaluates partner profitability using Excel. Unfortunately, it is discovered that the majority of partners are still incurring losses. This prompts further investigation into methods for ensuring partner profitability.

- Increasing Payouts or Decreasing Costs: The project explores two potential approaches to improve partner profitability. First, it examines the possibility of increasing partner payouts by encouraging higher load delivery. Second, it suggests adjusting the per-kg rates offered to partners based on their cost structure. The goal is to balance profitability by decreasing partners' cost per kg.

- Dashboard and EDA in Tableau: Tableau is utilized to create an interactive dashboard and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dashboard presents key findings, visualizations, and insights derived from the Excel analysis. It serves as a comprehensive tool for monitoring and managing partner payouts.

The repository contains the Excel files used for data analysis and modeling, as well as the Tableau workbook with the interactive dashboard. Documentation detailing the project methodology, findings, and recommendations is also provided.
